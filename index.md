## Oveview

This module offers students a comprehensive introduction to computational thinking and data science, equipping them with essential problem-solving skills and a solid understanding of the data science workflow. Throughout the module, students will develop proficiency in graph theory and its practical implementation, exploring trees & graph structures and algorithms like depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), and weighted-shortest path algorithms. The module also focuses on fostering stochastic thinking and enhancing statistical understanding, providing students with the knowledge to employ Monte Carlo simulation and analyze probability distributions, including the normal distribution and confidence levels. Additionally, the module offers practical insights into different probability distributions and their applications in data analysis. By combining theoretical concepts with practical exercises, students will develop essential skills in problem-solving using computational approaches. The module ensures that students gain a strong foundation in computational thinking and its applications in data science. Throughout the learning journey, students will be able to apply their newly acquired knowledge and skills to real-world scenarios, empowering them to approach data-driven problem-solving with confidence.
